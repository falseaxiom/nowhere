3: MOSQUITO SUMMER

THE AIR IS THICK WITH CRAVING
WALKING MARROW BY THE BILLIONS
        SANGUINE
SWEAT DRIPS LIKE A SYMPHONY
MY GREED WILL MAKE ME SICK AND SLOW
        SOMEDAY
BUT NOT TONIGHT
THE TABLE IS SET FOR ME
MY MEAL WRITHES IN THE KITCHEN
EVERYTHING I WANT MUST BE CARVED
OUT OF SOMETHING THAT WANTS TO LIVE
THANK GOD I'M MADE OF BLADES

                I'M TAKING WHAT'S MINE
                AND WHAT'S YOURS TOO
