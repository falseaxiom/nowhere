HORSEPOWER

I read somewhere once that when a horse lays down for too long its lungs start to collapse. I have no idea if that’s true but when I look at pictures of horses it seems plausible. Sometimes I think it’s a miracle they can stand at all. Those lithe limbs propping up bundles of rocketship muscle. A maserati on toothpick scaffolding. It’s our fault really. Man saw wild horse and innovated. Which is to say man saw potential and stretched it out of the horse. Generations of taffy pulling for a few years of anxious speed. Then cars came along and we spat them onto the racetrack. Imagine having a unit of power named after you and still

waking up trembling. Or maybe you don’t have to. Maybe you’re beautiful and brushable and untouchable too. Kick when you’re frightened. Run when you’re told to. Miles without distance. It’s a PR or a shotgun behind the shed. That’s just your workout mantra. You can smoke every other filly on this track but it’s all circles. It’s all noise. It blows back and hits your face every single time. Look up to the box seats. Money passing between hands. Tickets underfoot. A pencil-mark halo around every name except yours. No matter. Every night’s a thunderstorm and you’re still going. Smooth and dry and breathless. Here and there and back again.
