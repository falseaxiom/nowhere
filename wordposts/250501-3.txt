River

There’s a river that runs through the middle
of april wide as a vein It’s closed off most of
the time but on cloudy days i find myself at
its mouth with my hand in the water I don’t
mean to reach for the riverbed but there’s a
divot in the rocks where my palm fits
perfectly The water is cold I close my eyes
and try to remember What it feels like
Felt like When i open them again
i’m where i was before the river I mean
after No one knows where the river is
when i describe it to them I barely know
if it’s real I just know it was cold And i
was there
