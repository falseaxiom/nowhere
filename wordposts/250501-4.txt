13: FISHING

I’m smart enough to know the shape of a
bad idea. Desire, its shadow. Contours

like open wounds against the shifting sun.
I’ve been swimming for a long time in the

wrong direction. It tires you out, even when
you’re built for it. Seasons from now, I’ll reach

the beginning of this stream, features
worn smooth and indistinct by the world

rushing around and over me, and dissolve
away. Today, temptation and her silver curves

whirl in the current ahead. But I know what
comes next. A soft pink thing in the mouth

and a knife in the belly. I don’t look back as
we brush shoulders. I rarely get what I want.
