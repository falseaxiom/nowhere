15: lychgate

there’s not much to see. a roof, a
container, the brown-black softness of
decay. it’s raining. how long have you been
curled around it? does it still look
like you? funny how time goes one
way, but water goes where it pleases. here,
a few windswept drops cling
to the arm of your sweater. there, a puddle
crawls up your pant leg. open your
hands. it left long ago, or you lost it, or you
put it down yourself. come out from under there.
nothing is keeping you.
