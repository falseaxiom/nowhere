TIGHTEN UP!!

I won't be coy. In my mind,
three years of sainthood
had made me perfect and clean.
I fancied myself immune. Posthuman
in my needlessness. I hadn't
expected this. Some vestigial
sincerity--some wretched naivete--
had invited the infection. Call it
incredulity. It rendered me raw
as a newborn, and about as susceptible.
Want sputtered out of me, streaked
across my mouth, down the front of my
dress. Putrid unbecoming. I'm still
that animal I always was. Trembling
at the slightest touch (and its
absence). Wishing you would come over.
