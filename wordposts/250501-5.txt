Long Island Iced Tea

is the only thing on the menu at my
favorite bar. Efficiency is king, and I,
its most loyal subject. A smattering of
hard liquors guzzled into a glass heaped with ice,

the good kind that’s like chewing a hunk
of snow. A splash of Coke. A lime wedge
if I’m feeling fancy. One please. Thank
you. Gulp it down. Another. When I stand up,

I’m everyone else. A datapoint wobbling
across the dance floor, blurred joy, singing
loud and bad, moving cheap and fast.
Forward. Up. Who knows where. In the

steakhouse across the street, sophisticates sip
thirty-dollar espresso martinis, uncork bottles
of Riesling twice my age. Fine dining is a
sucker’s game. The night is dead before you feel

a thing. I could have thirty of their nights
in a weekend. I have. I’ve gamed the shit out of fun
and snagged the top prize. Crunching on the medals
at the bottom of my glass, dizzy.
