high tide

went to the beach. drew a line in the sand. watched the ocean rush forward and swallow the line. drew another. let it wash and level. lay down and let it cover me. cool in the night. packed up and moved far from the coast. blamed the tide for how it shifted. howled and cried. i’m sorry. it’s just water. it doesn’t know any other way to be.
