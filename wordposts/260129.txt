THE BITCHING AND MOANING DUOLOGY

I. ANYWAY,
Time passes. Often
I need to be reminded.
I’ve pissed away years
feeling sorry for
myself,
for my ideas, the lovely
blur of their edges, longing
to sharpen into view. But translation
is a futile task. A series of reaching
and failing—invariably,
humiliation. I’ve never known
the sheen of perfection; I don’t
have the patience. It’s easiest
to neglect the gnaw
entirely. Bad habits
become a life (or a lack). Small
happinesses, now and then,
bringing no relief.

II. HONE
Everything starts as a smudge. Even
you. A periphery, a
vagueness. Ugly,
insofar as you cannot be properly
witnessed. Fear and comfort--mine,
obviously--are your
keepers. If only
I loved you less, or loved
me more. I’d dedicate my hands
to your refinement. Yes,
that would be the noble thing
to do. Then, with time,
you’d cut your way clean
out of me. And
glow. And leave me,
kindly, to rot.
